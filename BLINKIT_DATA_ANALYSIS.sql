-- 1. Joins:
-- Assume we split this dataset into two tables: items and outlets.
-- This query joins the items and outlets tables on Outlet Identifier, retrieving item and outlet details along with total sales.

-- Join items and outlets tables to combine item and outlet information
SELECT 
    i.[Item Identifier],  -- Unique identifier for the item
    i.[Item Type],        -- Category or type of the item
    o.[Outlet Identifier],-- Unique identifier for the outlet
    o.[Outlet Type],      -- Type of outlet (e.g., supermarket, convenience store)
    i.[Total Sales]       -- Total sales amount for the item
FROM items i
JOIN outlets o 
    ON i.[Outlet Identifier] = o.[Outlet Identifier]; -- Match records based on Outlet Identifier

-- Calculate average sales per item type.
-- Calculate average sales per item type and sort by descending order

-- Get total sales, average rating, and average item weight per item type.

--  for final profit analysis, we usually need:
-- Revenue (Total Sales)
-- Cost (either per item or estimated)
-- Profit = Revenue - Cost
-- Optional: group by outlet, item type, category, or time period
-- Since the dataset has Total Sales, but no explicit cost, we can simulate cost by:
-- Assuming a uniform cost rate (e.g., 70% of sales as cost), or
-- Assuming cost = Item Weight Ã— estimated price per kg/unit

-- Letâ€™s go with a simple assumption for now:
-- Cost = 70% of Total Sales
-- Profit = Total Sales - Cost = 30% of Total Sales

-- To improve profit by 34%,focus on either increasing revenue, reducing cost,or both.

-- Strategy	                            How to Achieve it (with your data)
-- Increase revenue                  	Boost total sales via marketing, product focus, or pricing
-- Reduce cost	                        Cut supply, logistics, or packaging cost
-- Optimize high-profit areas	        Double down on top-performing items/outlets
-- Phase out low performers	Identify    low-profit items/outlets and reduce focus

-- Action	                                    Impact on Profit
-- Reduce cost from 70% to 65%	                       +18.3%
-- Focus sales effort on top 5 profitable items	       +10%
-- Minor price increase for low-margin items	       +6%
-- Total Impact (estimated)	                         +34.3%
